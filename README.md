# ember-auth-rails-demo

**The heroku app is not working yet: I am still writing this tutorial.**

This tutorial will create an app using rails + devise + ember-auth.
The demo can be seen live at [heroku](http://ember-auth-rails-demo.herokuapp.com/),
and the code lives in this repository itself.

The tutorial is [in the wiki](https://github.com/heartsentwined/ember-auth-rails-demo/wiki/Tutorial).
